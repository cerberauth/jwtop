```

## Library

The library is split into two packages:

| Package | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `github.com/cerberauth/jwtop/jwt` | Decode, verify, create tokens; key utilities |
| `github.com/cerberauth/jwtop/jwt/editor` | Re-sign and mutate existing tokens |

Add the packages you need:

```sh
# Core operations
go get github.com/cerberauth/jwtop/jwt

# Token editor (re-sign, mutate)
go get github.com/cerberauth/jwtop/jwt/editor
```

Then import them:

```go
import (
    "github.com/cerberauth/jwtop/jwt"
    "github.com/cerberauth/jwtop/jwt/editor"
)
```

## Requirements

- Go 1.24 or later (for the library)
- Any platform supported by the Go toolchain (for the CLI)
