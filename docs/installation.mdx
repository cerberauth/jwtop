# Installation

## CLI

Install the latest binary with `go install`:

go install github.com/cerberauth/jwtop@latest
```

Verify the installation:

```sh

```

### Other installation methods

**Docker**

```

**From source**

```sh
git clone https://github.com/cerberauth/jwtop.git
cd jwtop
go build -o jwtop .
```

## Library

The library is split into focused packages:

| Package | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `github.com/cerberauth/jwtop/jwt` | Decode, verify, create tokens; key utilities |
| `github.com/cerberauth/jwtop/jwt/editor` | Re-sign and mutate existing tokens |
| `github.com/cerberauth/jwtop/jwt/exploit` | Standalone exploit primitives + HMAC secret cracking |
| `github.com/cerberauth/jwtop/jwt/crack` | Probe a server for JWT vulnerabilities |

Add the packages you need:

```sh
# Core operations
go get github.com/cerberauth/jwtop/jwt

# Token editor (re-sign, mutate)
go get github.com/cerberauth/jwtop/jwt/editor

# Security exploits and secret cracking
go get github.com/cerberauth/jwtop/jwt/exploit

# Server vulnerability probing
go get github.com/cerberauth/jwtop/jwt/crack
```

Then import them:

```go
import (
    "github.com/cerberauth/jwtop/jwt"
    "github.com/cerberauth/jwtop/jwt/editor"
    "github.com/cerberauth/jwtop/jwt/exploit"
    "github.com/cerberauth/jwtop/jwt/crack"
)
```

## Requirements
