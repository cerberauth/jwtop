# Inspect an unknown JWT

When you receive a JWT from a third-party service, a log, or a debug session, you often want to read its content before you have the signing key or know the algorithm. `jwtop decode` does this without any key material.

## With the CLI

```sh
jwtop decode <token>
```

Example — inspect a token from an environment variable:

```sh
jwtop decode $ACCESS_TOKEN
```

Output:

```
Header:
{
  "alg": "RS256",
  "typ": "JWT",
  "kid": "abc123"
}

Claims:
{
  "sub": "user-42",
  "iss": "https://auth.example.com",
  "aud": "api.example.com",
  "exp": 1740000000,
  "iat": 1739996400,
  "roles": ["admin", "editor"]
}

Signature:
<base64url>
```

## What to look for

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| `alg` | Signing algorithm — determines what key type to use for verification |
| `kid` | Key ID — use with a JWKS endpoint to fetch the right public key |
| `exp` | Expiration timestamp (Unix) — check if the token is still valid |
| `iss` | Issuer — confirms the token origin |
| `sub` | Subject — the principal the token represents |

## Next step

Once you know the algorithm and have the key, use [`jwtop verify`](../cli/verify) to confirm the signature.
