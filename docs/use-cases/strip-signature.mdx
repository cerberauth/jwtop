# Strip or remove a token signature

Some security tests require tokens with no valid signature — for example, checking that your server rejects unsigned tokens, or testing behaviour when `alg` is `"none"`. `jwtop sign --alg none` covers this case.

## Produce an alg=none token

```sh
jwtop sign $TOKEN --alg none
```

The resulting token has its header `alg` field set to `"none"` and an empty signature segment:

```
eyJhbGciOiJub25lIiwidHlwIjoiSldUIn0.eyJzdWIiOiJ1c2VyLTQyIn0.
```

No `--secret` or `--key` flag is needed.

## When to use this

**Testing that your server rejects alg=none**

A correctly configured JWT library should reject tokens with `alg=none` unless explicitly configured to allow it. Use this to verify that your server does the right thing:

```sh
UNSIGNED=$(jwtop sign $TOKEN --alg none)

# Expect a 401
curl -si -H "Authorization: Bearer $UNSIGNED" https://api.example.com/me \
  | head -1
```

**Checking claim validation independent of signature**

If you want to test claim parsing logic (expired token, wrong issuer, etc.) in a context where the signature check is already disabled in your test harness:

```sh
jwtop sign $TOKEN --alg none
```

## Difference between alg=none and an empty signature

| | `--alg none` | `WithoutSignature` (library) |
|---|---|---|
| Header `alg` field | Changed to `"none"` | Unchanged |
| Signature segment | Empty | Empty |

Use `--alg none` from the CLI. The `WithoutSignature` method on `editor.TokenEditor` is available in the Go library when you need the header alg preserved:

```go
import "github.com/cerberauth/jwtop/jwt/editor"

te, _ := editor.NewTokenEditor(existingToken)
noSig, err := te.WithoutSignature()
```

## Security note

Tokens with `alg=none` should never be accepted by a production server. This feature is intended for security testing and local development only.
