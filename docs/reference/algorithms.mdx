# Supported algorithms

JWTop supports all algorithm families defined by [RFC 7518](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7518).

## Algorithm table

| Family | Algorithms | Key type |
|---|---|---|
| HMAC | `HS256`, `HS384`, `HS512` | Shared secret (`[]byte`) |
| RSA PKCS#1 v1.5 | `RS256`, `RS384`, `RS512` | RSA private/public key |
| RSA-PSS | `PS256`, `PS384`, `PS512` | RSA private/public key |
| ECDSA | `ES256`, `ES384`, `ES512` | EC private/public key |
| None | `none` | No key required |

## Algorithm selection guide

**Choose HMAC (HS256 / HS384 / HS512)** when:
- The same service both issues and verifies tokens.
- Simplicity and performance are priorities.
- The secret can be stored securely on both sides.

**Choose RSA or EC (RS256, ES256, …)** when:
- Multiple services need to verify tokens without access to the signing key.
- You publish a JWKS endpoint for key discovery.
- You need to rotate keys without sharing secrets.

**ES256 vs RS256**: ECDSA keys are smaller and operations are faster at equivalent security levels. Prefer ES256 for new deployments.

**PS256 vs RS256**: RSA-PSS (`PS*`) is more resistant to certain theoretical attacks than PKCS#1 v1.5 (`RS*`). Both are acceptable in practice.

## Generating keys

Use standard tools to generate PEM key pairs:

```sh
# RSA 2048-bit
openssl genrsa -out private.pem 2048
openssl rsa -in private.pem -pubout -out public.pem

# EC P-256 (for ES256)
openssl ecparam -name prime256v1 -genkey -noout -out private.pem
openssl ec -in private.pem -pubout -out public.pem

# EC P-384 (for ES384)
openssl ecparam -name secp384r1 -genkey -noout -out private.pem
openssl ec -in private.pem -pubout -out public.pem
```
