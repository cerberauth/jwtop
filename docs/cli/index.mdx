# CLI reference

The `jwtop` CLI provides four commands covering the full JWT workflow.

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| [`decode`](./decode) | Decode and pretty-print a token without verifying its signature |
| [`verify`](./verify) | Verify a token's signature and standard claims |
| [`create`](./create) | Create and sign a new token from scratch |
| [`sign`](./sign) | Re-sign an existing token with a different algorithm or key |

## Global usage

```
jwtop <command> [flags]
jwtop --help
jwtop version
```

All commands exit `0` on success and `1` on error. Verification failure also exits `1`.
